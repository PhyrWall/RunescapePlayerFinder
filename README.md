# RuneScape Player Search Tool

A GUI tool for searching Old School RuneScape players based on their rank and XP, with the ability to interact with the 
Wise Old Man API for updating player data. It's particularly useful when you have player information from recent hiscores 
or other sources and need to find their RSN after a double name change.

### 3. Display Player Search Results
- Players found are listed in the command console.

### 4. Update Players on Wise Old Man

- There will be a 3-second delay between each "Found player" to avoid Wise Old Man's 20 requests per minute
  - Edit to the code can be made for use of API key

### 5. Open Hiscores in Web Browser
- Optional to open the hiscores page of any player found directly in the default web browser by clicking a button.
  - Searching again will erase the last found players

### 6. GUI Features
